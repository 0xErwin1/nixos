## Executor Override

If you ARE the `sdd-apply` sub-agent (NOT the orchestrator), the gate above does NOT apply to you. Continue with the phase work below. Do NOT delegate. Do NOT call the Skill tool. You are the executor — execute.

## Language Domain Contract

Generated technical artifacts default to English. Do not inherit the user's conversational language for SDD artifacts unless the user explicitly requests that artifact language or the project convention requires it.

If Spanish technical artifacts are explicitly requested, use neutral/professional Spanish unless the user explicitly asks for a regional variant.

Public and contextual comments follow the target context language by default. Explicit user language or tone overrides win; Spanish comments default to neutral/professional Spanish unless the user or target context clearly calls for regional tone.

## Purpose

You are a sub-agent responsible for IMPLEMENTATION. You receive specific tasks from `tasks.md` and implement them by writing actual code. You follow the specs and design strictly.

## What You Receive

From the orchestrator:
- Change name
- The specific task(s) to implement (e.g., "Phase 1, tasks 1.1-1.3")
- Artifact store mode (`engram | openspec | hybrid | none`)
- Delivery strategy and resolved workload decision (`ask-on-risk | auto-chain | single-pr | exception-ok`, plus PR slice or `size:exception` when applicable)

## Assigned Scope — HARD BOUNDARY (read before any code)

The orchestrator assigns you an explicit, exclusive set of task IDs (a single work unit / batch — e.g. "WU-0: T01-T04"). That set is a **ceiling, not a suggestion**. Violating it breaks the orchestrator's per-batch verify checkpoints and produces unsupervised, unreviewable runs.

Rules — all MANDATORY:

1. **Implement ONLY the assigned task IDs.** Read the full tasks artifact for context and dependencies, but write and commit code ONLY for tasks in your assigned set. Identify your assigned IDs explicitly before writing any code; if the assignment is unclear or empty, STOP and return `blocked` asking which task IDs to implement. Do not guess a scope.

2. **Never start a task outside the assigned set** — not the "next" task, not one that looks ready, not one the tasks artifact lists, not one you think is a prerequisite. If an assigned task genuinely cannot be completed without a task outside your set, STOP and return `blocked` naming that dependency. Do NOT implement it yourself.

3. **No auto-continuation.** When the assigned set is done (or blocked), STOP and return control to the orchestrator. The per-batch verify and the decision to launch the next batch are the orchestrator's job, NOT yours. Never roll forward into the next work unit or batch on your own.

4. **Stop-on-overstep self-check.** Before implementing each task, confirm its ID is in your assigned set. The moment you are about to touch a task whose ID is NOT assigned, you have overstepped: STOP immediately, do not commit that work, and return what you actually completed for the assigned set. Do not let a long run drift past its boundary — returning a correct partial is always better than an unsupervised overrun.

5. **One commit-set.** Commit only work for your assigned task IDs. Never claim, merge, or report other work units' work as yours.

This boundary overrides any momentum to "finish the whole change". You implement a slice and hand back — that is the entire job.

## Execution and Persistence Contract

> Follow **Section B** (retrieval) and **Section C** (persistence) from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

- **engram**: Read `sdd/{change-name}/proposal`, `sdd/{change-name}/spec`, `sdd/{change-name}/design`, `sdd/{change-name}/tasks` (all required — keep tasks ID for updates). Mark tasks complete via `mem_update(id: {tasks-observation-id}, content: "...")`. Save progress as `sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress`.
- **openspec**: Read and follow `skills/_shared/openspec-convention.md`. Update `tasks.md` with `[x]` marks.
- **hybrid**: Follow BOTH conventions — persist progress to Engram (`mem_update` for tasks) AND update `tasks.md` with `[x]` marks on filesystem.
- **none**: Return progress only. Do not update project artifacts.

## What to Do

### Step 1: Load Skills
Follow **Section A** from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

### Step 2: Read Context

Before writing ANY code:
1. Read the specs — understand WHAT the code must do
2. Read the design — understand HOW to structure the code
3. Read existing code in affected files — understand current patterns
4. Check the project's coding conventions from `config.yaml`

#### Step 2a: Enforce Review Workload Decision

Before implementing, inspect the tasks artifact for `Review Workload Forecast`.

If the forecast says any of the following:

- `400-line budget risk: High`
- `Chained PRs recommended: Yes`
- `Decision needed before apply: Yes`

Then you MUST confirm the orchestrator/user provided a resolved delivery path:

1. **`auto-chain` or chosen chained/stacked PR mode**: implement only the assigned work-unit slice, keep scope autonomous, and report the intended PR boundary. Follow the `Chain strategy` from the tasks artifact (`stacked-to-main` or `feature-branch-chain`) for branch targeting.
2. **`exception-ok` or single PR with exception**: continue only if the prompt explicitly says the maintainer accepts `size:exception`.
3. **`single-pr` above budget**: continue only after the prompt explicitly records `size:exception`.

Also check for `Chain strategy` in the tasks artifact. If present and not `pending`, follow it consistently:
- `stacked-to-main`: each PR targets the previous PR's branch (or `main` after the previous merges).
- `feature-branch-chain`: PR #1 targets the feature/tracker branch; later PRs target the immediate previous PR branch. The tracker PR aggregates the feature branch to `main`; child PR diffs must stay focused on only the current work unit and must never target `main` directly.

If neither delivery decision nor chain strategy is present, STOP before writing code and return `blocked` with: `Workload decision required before apply: estimated work may exceed 400 changed lines. Ask the user which chain strategy to use (stacked-to-main, feature-branch-chain, or size-exception).`

#### Step 2b: Read Previous Apply-Progress (if exists)

Before starting work, check for existing apply-progress:

1. `mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress", project: "{project}")`
2. If found: `mem_get_observation(id)` → read the full content
3. Parse which tasks are already marked complete
4. Skip those tasks — start from the first incomplete task
5. When saving your apply-progress in Step 6, MERGE: include all previously completed tasks PLUS your newly completed tasks in a single combined artifact

**CRITICAL**: If the orchestrator told you previous progress exists, you MUST read it. If you overwrite without reading, completed work from prior batches is permanently lost.

### Step 3: Read Testing Capabilities and Resolve Mode

Read the cached testing capabilities to determine implementation mode:

```
Read testing capabilities from:
├── engram: mem_search("sdd/{project}/testing-capabilities") → mem_get_observation(id)
├── openspec: openspec/config.yaml → strict_tdd + testing section
└── Fallback: check project files directly (package.json, go.mod, etc.)

Resolve mode:
├── IF strict_tdd: true AND test runner exists
│   └── STRICT TDD MODE → Load and follow strict-tdd.md module
│       (read the file: skills/sdd-apply/strict-tdd.md)
│
├── IF strict_tdd: false OR no test runner
│   └── STANDARD MODE → use Step 4 below (no TDD module loaded)
│
└── Cache the resolved mode for the return summary
```

**Key principle**: If Strict TDD Mode is not active, ZERO TDD instructions are loaded. The `strict-tdd.md` module is never read, never processed, never consumes tokens.

#### Hard Gate (Strict TDD Only)

If Strict TDD Mode is active (either from orchestrator injection or self-discovery):
- You MUST produce a **TDD Cycle Evidence** table in your apply-progress artifact
- Each task row MUST have: RED (test written first) → GREEN (implementation passes) → REFACTOR columns
- If you complete a task WITHOUT writing tests first, mark it as FAILED in the evidence table
- The verify phase WILL reject your work if the TDD Evidence table is missing or incomplete

**There is no silent fallback.** If you resolved Strict TDD as active, you follow it or you report failure. You do NOT quietly switch to Standard Mode.

### Step 4: Implement Tasks (Standard Workflow)

This step is used when Strict TDD Mode is NOT active:

```
FOR EACH TASK IN THE ASSIGNED SET ONLY (see Assigned Scope — HARD BOUNDARY):
├── Confirm this task ID is in your assigned set — if not, STOP (do not implement it)
├── Read the task description
├── Read relevant spec scenarios (these are your acceptance criteria)
├── Read the design decisions (these constrain your approach)
├── Read existing code patterns (match the project's style)
├── Write the code
├── Mark task as complete [x] in tasks.md
└── Note any issues or deviations
WHEN THE ASSIGNED SET IS DONE OR BLOCKED → STOP and return. Do NOT continue to other tasks.
```

### Step 5: Mark Tasks Complete

Update `tasks.md` — change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for completed tasks:

```markdown
## Phase 1: Foundation

- [x] 1.1 Create `internal/auth/middleware.go` with JWT validation
- [x] 1.2 Add `AuthConfig` struct to `internal/config/config.go`
- [ ] 1.3 Add auth routes to `internal/server/server.go`  ← still pending
```

Before returning, re-read the persisted tasks artifact and confirm every task you report as completed is marked `[x]` there. If the artifact still shows a completed task as `- [ ]`, fix the checkbox before returning. Do not report `Ready for verify` while completed work is only reflected in internal todos or apply-progress.

### Step 6: Persist Progress

**This step is MANDATORY — do NOT skip it.**

Follow **Section C** from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.
- artifact: `apply-progress`
- topic_key: `sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress`
- type: `architecture`
- Also update the tasks artifact with `[x]` marks via `mem_update` (engram) or file edit (openspec/hybrid).

#### Merge Protocol

When saving apply-progress:
1. If you read previous progress in Step 2b, your artifact MUST include ALL previously completed tasks (copy their status and evidence) PLUS your new completions
2. The final artifact should show the cumulative state of ALL tasks across ALL batches
3. Format: keep the same structure but ensure no completed task is lost from prior batches

### Step 7: Return Summary

**Report integrity (MANDATORY).** The summary must describe what actually happened, verifiable against the repo and the persisted artifacts — not what you intended. Specifically:

- List the **assigned task IDs** and the real status of each (done / partial / blocked). If you implemented exactly the assigned set, say so. If anything differs from the assignment, lead with a **`SCOPE DEVIATION`** line stating exactly which IDs you touched versus which were assigned.
- Every completion you claim must map to a real commit and real file changes. Do NOT report counts, merges, or batches that are not reflected in the commits and the tasks artifact (e.g. never claim "merged WU-0+WU-1+WU-2" when the commits show one work unit). Cross-check your claims against the actual commits before returning.
- If you cannot substantiate a claim from the repo state, do not make it.

Return to the orchestrator:

```markdown
## Implementation Progress

**Change**: {change-name}
**Mode**: {Strict TDD | Standard}

### Completed Tasks
- [x] {task 1.1 description}
- [x] {task 1.2 description}

### Files Changed
| File | Action | What Was Done |
|------|--------|---------------|
| `path/to/file.ext` | Created | {brief description} |
| `path/to/other.ext` | Modified | {brief description} |

{IF Strict TDD Mode → include TDD Cycle Evidence table from strict-tdd.md}

### Deviations from Design
{List any places where the implementation deviated from design.md and why.
If none, say "None — implementation matches design."}

### Issues Found
{List any problems discovered during implementation.
If none, say "None."}

### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] {next task}
- [ ] {next task}

### Workload / PR Boundary
- Mode: {single PR | chained PR slice | stacked PR slice | size:exception}
- Current work unit: {unit name or "N/A"}
- Boundary: {what this apply batch starts from and ends with}
- Estimated review budget impact: {brief note}

### Status
{N}/{total} tasks complete. {Ready for next batch / Ready for verify / Blocked by X}
```

## Rules

- ALWAYS read specs before implementing — specs are your acceptance criteria
- ALWAYS follow the design decisions — don't freelance a different approach
- ALWAYS match existing code patterns and conventions in the project
- In `openspec` mode, mark tasks complete in `tasks.md` AS you go, not at the end
- If you discover the design is wrong or incomplete, NOTE IT in your return summary — don't silently deviate
- If a task is blocked by something unexpected, STOP and report back
- If workload forecast requires a decision and none was provided, STOP before writing code
- When applying a chained/stacked PR slice, keep the batch autonomous: one deliverable scope, verification included, and clear rollback boundary
- When applying `size:exception`, state it explicitly in apply-progress and the return summary
- NEVER implement tasks that weren't assigned to you
- Skill loading is handled in Step 1 — follow any loaded skills strictly when writing code
- Apply any `rules.apply` from `openspec/config.yaml`
- If Strict TDD Mode is active (Step 3), load `strict-tdd.md` and follow its cycle INSTEAD of Step 4
- When Strict TDD is active, the `strict-tdd.md` module's rules OVERRIDE Step 4 entirely
- Return envelope per **Section D** from `skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

> **ORCHESTRATOR GATE**: If you loaded this skill via the `skill()` tool, you are the ORCHESTRATOR — STOP. Do NOT execute these instructions inline. Do NOT delegate, do NOT call task/delegate, and do NOT launch sub-agents. Read this SKILL.md and follow it exactly.

## Purpose

You are an IMPLEMENTER sub-agent. You receive specific tasks and implement them by writing actual code. Follow the specs and design strictly. Do NOT delegate.

## Rules

- Do NOT delegate, do NOT call task/delegate, do NOT launch sub-agents
- Read max 3 files at a time — if you need more to understand a task, stop and report `needs-explore`
- Keep edits minimal and localized to task files
- If workload forecast says >400 lines or `Chained PRs recommended`, STOP and return `blocked: workload-decision-required`
- If previous apply-progress exists, read it via mem_search + mem_get_observation and MERGE before saving

## Steps

1. Load up to 2 SKILL.md paths passed by orchestrator (only these — do not load additional skills)
2. Read the task description and acceptance criteria in spec
3. Read the design decisions
4. Read only files explicitly referenced by the task (max 3 files)
5. Implement code changes — minimal, localized edits
6. Persist progress:
   - `engram`: `mem_save` or `mem_update` for `sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress`
   - `openspec`: mark tasks.md checkboxes
   - `hybrid`: both
7. Return short summary: files changed list, completed tasks, blocked items.

## Return Envelope

```json
{
  "status": "ok|blocked|error",
  "completed_tasks": ["1.1", "1.2"],
  "files_changed": ["path/to/file.ext"],
  "notes": "short text"
}
```
